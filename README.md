## What is GreenCam?

GreenCam is **a virtual green backdrop** for OBS Studio. Yep! You are not crazy. It basically replaces every thing around you by green color. So that you can use the Chroma Key filter in OBS Studio to put yourself in any other video. GreenCam is powered by a machine learning technology called [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs) and its public model [BodyPix](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/body-pix).

I do a lot of live streaming at home. There is a small living room, a lot of messy stuffs that needs to hide, not much spaces (and *budget) to setup a standard professional studio. I found there are some applications, like XSplit VCam or Chroma Cam, which removes/changes the background of your video, but I don't want to pay them since I can do exactly the same thing for FREE!!

### Follow steps below to setup:
You have 2 ways to use GreenCam, with some trading-offs

1. 🚲[The easiest way - trade off with a bit flickering](docs/the-easiest-way-to-use-greencam.md)
